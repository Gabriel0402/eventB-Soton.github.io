  "__html": "<h1>CODA Component Diagram models</h1>\n<p>CODA is a component modelling approach for rigorous hardware design, which has been developed at Southampton in collaboration with UK industry.</p>\n<p>CODA includes a new kind of diagram that integrates with the UML-B tool suite. CODA provides an environment for modelling hierarchical components that communicate via timed channels.</p>\n<p>The internal behaviour of the component can be modelled using embedded UML-B state-machines. The state-machine transitions can control, or be triggered by, the componentâ€™s port operations.</p>\n<p>CODA also has a mechanism for decomposition so that complex models can be managed as a collection of independently refined and verified component models.</p>\n<p>CODA integrates with hardware design automation flows through capabilities for generating VHDL hardware descriptions from CODA component models. The CODA tool suite is released open-source alongside the UML-B diagrammatic modelling tools.</p>\n",
