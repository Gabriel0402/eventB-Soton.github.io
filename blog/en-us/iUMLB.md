# iUML-B New Release

A new release of iUML-B is available.

This release includes new features for class diagrams - listed below. There are a number of stability improvements which affect iUML-B State-machines and the underlying frameworks and translators.

This release is compatible with the recent new release of Camille - it is recommended to upgrade both iUML-B and Camille at the same time.

New Class diagram features:
1) Classes can own state-machines
2) Attributes are total functions by default
3) Attributes and initialisations can be initialised to whole mappings (i.e. instead of per instance. start value with ":=" etc)
4) Quantification is suppressed if Class constraints do not refer to self-name
5) Class constraints can be generated into seen/extended contexts
6) A class can be defined as an Enumeration
7) Class methods can be extended
8) Sub-type classes can be grouped into disjoint or partitions
