# Developing UML-B for Avionics

The HiClass project is a consortium of industrial partners from the avionics domain supported by several universities including the University of Southampton. The aim of the project is to improve the way the industrial partners use model-based development in the avionics domain.

To support the industrial partners, we are investigating methods and tool support for refining system level models to individual component specifications. We are also improving the text-based user interface to provide new record structuring features.
